# Comparison of missing data handling methods in building variant pathogenicity metapredictors

## Description

This project will compare methods for handling missing data in variant annotations for the purpose of building variant pathogenicity metapredictors.

See [the research plan](docs/research_plan/research_plan.md) for a more detailed description.

To generate a PDF version with a working references section:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss.git
$ cd amiss/docs/research_plan
$ make
```

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and a [LaTeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/) must be installed.

## Paper draft

The development of the draft paper describing this project can also be followed in [the repository](docs/paper/paper.pdf).

## Instructions

To reproduce the main results: (roughly estimated execution times in parentheses)

Note: the following instructions assume that you clone the repository into your home folder. Remember to adjust the paths if another base directory is used.


1. Clone the git repository with `git clone https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss.git`
2. [Acquire and annotate variant data](docs/instructions/annotation.md) (~3 h)
3. [Acquire CADD annotations](docs/instructions/cadd_data_download.md) (300 GB download!)
4. Using the repository root as working directory, run the scripts in order:
    - 01_parse_vcf.R (<1 hour)
    - 02_1_expand_data.R (<1 min)
    - 02_2_contract_data.R (<1 min)
    - optional: use Rstudio to view 03_descriptive_stats.Rmd ([knitted pdf here](R/03_descriptive_stats.pdf)) (1-5 min)
    - 04_impute_and_train.R (tested with 24 cores available: ~24 hours)
    - 05_test_prediction.R (1-2 hours)
    - TODO: 06_analyze_main_results.R

5. To reproduce simulation results, run also
    - WIP: 07_generate_simulated_data.R
    - TODO: 08_run_simulations.R
    - TODO: 08_analyze_results.R

## Open science

This project conforms to the principles of open science:

- Open data:
  - We use and reference publically available datasets and will citably archive any data and code we produce using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) with a DOI
- Open source:
  - The source code is freely available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss/blob/master/LICENSE) at [GitHub](https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss)
- Open notebook:
  - You can follow development from the start on GitHub at https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss
  - The research plan is available [in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss/blob/master/docs/research_plan/research_plan.md) (see [section above](#description) for producing a PDF version)
- Open access:
  - We will upload a preprint of the resulting paper(s) on [biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)
  - We will submit the results for publication in a peer-reviewed open access journal
- Open communication:
  - We intend to present the results in public scientific conferences
- Open collaboration:
  - We welcome
    - [ideas, bug reports and comments](https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss/issues)
    - [code contributions through GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/blueprint-genetics/amiss/pulls)
